I'm gettin kinda tired of this
Prepublication media blitz
You've got all of muggle kind under your spell

Don't you know the whole world's already gone
And reserved a copy at Amazon
How many more books could you sell?
Now give me my book or go to hell!

'Cause I need Harry Potter
Like a grindylow needs water
And as Saturday approaches my need grows

Accio Deathly Hallows
Incendio book sales embargoes;
It'll be like phoenix tears on a broken nose
Accio Deathly Hallows
Accio Deathly Hallows

I'm getting kinda petrified:
What would Ron do if Hermione died?
Or if Voldemort killed Hedwig just for yuks?

I have no confidence
In theories about the half blood prince
And what if Harry's brain is a horcrux?
Holy crap that would freakin' suck!

'Cause I need Harry Potter
Like a grindylow needs water
And as Saturday approaches my need grows

Whatever's up the sleeves of JK Rowling
I bet it has to do with Snape unbreakably vowing
To protect that pureblood pus-face Malfoy
But in the end I don't think it's gonna matter
If Snape's good or if he's bad
Because the weight of the world rests on our boy
Yeah, the weight of the world rests on our boy

'Cause we need Harry Potter
Like a grindylow needs water
And as Saturday approaches our need grows

Accio Deathly Hallows

It'll be like phoenix tears on a broken nose
Accio Deathly Hallows

But mostly I'm just feelin' sad
And I know this could end real bad but
I wish it didn't have to end at all
Yeah, I wish it didn't have to end at all

'Cause I couldn't care more about Harry Potter
If Hogwarts was my alma mater
And as Saturday approaches my need grows
